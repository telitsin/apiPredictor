# apiPredictor
this project uses FASTAPI lib.
One can modify app.py to use real models to predict instead of fake LoadModel class which just emulate prediction
IP address and port can be changed in main.py if necessary
Use http://XXXX:3500/docs link to check the API where XXX is IP address you used for your API
